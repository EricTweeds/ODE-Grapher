# ODE-Grapher
Python Script that creates graphs needed for an ODE's project

## Rules:
- The function must be inside quotation marks
- No need to add y=, just include everything past the equals sign
- Use * for multiplication, / for division, \**\ for exponent, exp(x) for e^x
- When all the functions for the graph are entered, press enter and leave the final equation blank, the script will interpret this as saying done.
